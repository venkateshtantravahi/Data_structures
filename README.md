# Data_structures and algorithms 
Everything you need to start DS and algorithms based on data sctructures

Basically this repo is more kind of educational purpose, open source for everyone and it will be a good insight for the learners who are new to the word data structures. Mostly this repo is for some one who wants to know about why and what of ds and how to implement them  in various programming languages. This is for 
the people who already had some prior knowledge about basic programming concepts such as looping , variable declaration, functions etc.. 

### Prerequisites
- Having a prior knowledge of some basic programming concepts helps to understand well.
- To run the following programs present in the repo your pc/laptop should have python, java installed if not refer the below installation.

### Installation
- For windows there will be gui's available in off websites download and follow installation 

```
Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Java : https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
```
- For Ubuntu you need to install packages from the terminal

```
Python: sudo apt install python
Java : sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre
```

### Running scripts
- For windows open the shell at desired folder 
   - for python file 
      ```C:\devspace> hello.py```
   - for java file first we need to compile and then execute the code 
      ```
         C:\devspace> javac filename.java
         C:\devspace> java filename.java
      ```
- For Ubuntu open the terminal 
  - for python file \
    ```xyz-PC:-$ python filename.py```
  - for java file 
      ```
      xyz-PC:-$ javac filename.java
      xyz-PC:-$ java filename.java
      ```
### Languages Used
