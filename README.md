# Data_structures
Everything you need to start DS

Basically this repo is more kind of educational purpose, giving an idea about what is meant by data structures and \
what is time complexity of a program and how to cal it? \ 
what are different forms of data structures along with thier psuedo codes and readme 's \
It will be updated on weekly basis with the new topic added \
and I like contributors to contribute some challenges to the learners which is more kind of helpful in improving thier skills.
